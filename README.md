# diabetes-predictor-using-machine-learning

## Overview
This is a machine learning-based project designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using a trained model. The predictor achieves an accuracy of 80% and is built to assist in early detection based on relevant health data. It serves as a practical application of machine learning techniques for healthcare analysis.

## Features
- Diabetes Prediction: Classifies whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on input features.
- High Accuracy: Achieves 80% accuracy on the test dataset.
- User-Friendly: Simple interface for inputting patient data and receiving predictions.
- Scalable: Can be extended with additional features or datasets.



## Usage
- Input Data: Provide patient details (e.g., age, glucose, BMI) through the script or notebook interface.
- Prediction: The model outputs a probability or binary result (e.g., 0 for no diabetes, 1 for diabetes).
- Accuracy Check: The 80% accuracy is based on cross-validation with the test dataset.
